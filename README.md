## Indian Traffic Sign Prediction (Course Project)
##### ● Developed a machine learning model such as ANN,CNN for classifying traffic signs most of which are specific to India.
##### ● Traffic signal dataset Train and Test file. Train file has 932 images along with their class column.each row corresponds to a traffic sign image and a small number of other features.
##### ● Test file has 400 images for which class need to be predited.
##### ● During model building, following steps were done - Data loading,Data Scaling,Data augmentation and Resampling using SMOTETomek and hyperparameter tunning etc.
